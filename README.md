## Hello! 👋 

My name is Dmitrii Govor, a detail-oriented, multilingual professional based in Vancouver, WA, with a passion for Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science 🚀 . I have gained some skills from my time as a Process Engineer at Intel and as a Master of Engineering alumni from the University of Victoria in BC, Canada 🇨🇦. I am driven to solve difficult problems and greatly enjoy learning new skills. I strive to become a swiss army knife of an engineer capable of mastering a wide range of skills and programming languages 🛠️. 

💡 Please take a look at some of my highlighted projects:
- 🤟 [Sign Language Translator](https://github.com/dgovor/Sign-Language-Translator/tree/main): **Python-powered Neural Network magic** with LSTM and Dense layers, bringing communication to a new level.
- 🏠 [Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/dgovor/Housing-Price-Prediction-Python): **Robust ML model** written in **Python** for precise price predictions, eliminating outliers and normalizing values.
- 💓 [Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/dgovor/Heart-Failure-Prediction): **Python ML model** trained using Kaggle dataset, offering a solution to a critical problem.
- 🧩 [Eight Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/dgovor/Eight-Puzzle-Solver): **AI model** solving the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm in **MATLAB**.
